# Butterfly-AI ðŸ¦‹
A model based on [VGG-16](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/vgg16.html#) for identifying and classifying butterfly species from images. After 5 epochs the model achieves an accuracy of around **70%**.

This project was intended to improve my understanding of AI in a fun way. Please don't expect it to be perfect.
