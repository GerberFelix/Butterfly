# Butterfly-AI ðŸ¦‹
A model based on [VGG-16](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/vgg16.html#) for identifying and classifying butterfly species from images. After 5 epochs the model achieves an accuracy of around **70%**.

This project was intended to improve my understanding of AI in a fun way. 

## How to use
Make sure that you have all the right python-modules by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Put the train/test folders and the .csv files of the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phucthaiv02/butterfly-image-classification?select=Training_set.csv) into the same directory as the **main.py** file. 

### Disclaimer 
I do **not** own the rights of the dataset.
